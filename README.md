# MNIST
PyTorch codes for classifying the MNIST handwritten digits using a Logistic Regression model, a two layer feedforward neural network and a CNN (LeNet5 architecture). Each notebook also contains the code for displaying incorrectly classified images. The test set accuracies for all the models are as follows - 

|         Model        | Test Accuracy |
|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
| Logistic Regression  | 92.4%         |
| Two layer neural net | 97.8%         |
| CNN (LeNet5)         | 98.94%        |
